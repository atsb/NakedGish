# NakedGish
NakedGish is a modernised direct 64bit port of the original Gish that is 100% compatible with vanilla Gish.

# What is the state
NakedGish is not yet ready for prime-time.  Mostly due to having to support the Steam release of the game (due to it not being available anywhere else to buy) and most people won't have the original from the Humble Bundle.

This involves many previous .tga files now being .png and I have to change this.
